# Overview

Internationalization is an import aspect of your application. Not to mention that it is very tricky, as [some companies](https://www.translatemedia.com/translation-blog/coca-cola-cancels-french-campaign-due-to-translation-blunder/) have already experienced. Internationalization of often called I18n, where the 18 stands for the letters in the word, is translating the application into the prefered language of chose for the end user. Do not confuse this with localization, which also means that you're adjusting your website for the end user his/her culture (date formatting, currency, ...).

We're going to create a simple website with 2 pages containing some text. After that we'll implement internationalization so that we can support different languages. As a finishing touch, we'll store the language preference in a cookie.

## Setting up the website

Create a new project with:

```bash
$ mix phx.new i18n --no-ecto --no-webpack --umbrella --no-dashboard
```

_**Make sure this a umbrella project in order to get a deeper understanding how Phoenix uses gettext! You'll also acquire important insights regarding circular dependencies and how these can be resolved.**_

Adjust the following files, an in-depth explanation should no longer be necessary of the following changes:

```elixir
# i18n_web/router.ex
  scope "/", I18nWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
    get "/another_index", PageController, :another_index
  end
```
Make sure that there is a route to access your application. As you can see the route to :index is already present.

```elixir
defmodule I18nWeb.PageController do
  use I18nWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "index.html")
  end

  def another_index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "another_index.html")
  end
end
```

The route points toward a controller having 2 functions. A function 'index' and a function 'another_index'. Make sure the controller and the appropriate functions are present. As you can see the index/2 function is already present.

```html
<!-- templates/layout/app.html.eex -->
      <nav role="navigation">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="/">HOME</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/another_index">ANOTHER INDEX</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
```
Edit the application layout so both pages share a common layout to switch between pages. Make sure to only overwrite the existing nav part

```html
<!-- templates/page/index.html.eex -->
<p>Welcome to the world of Elixir and Phoenix!</p>
```
All existing index.html.eex code can be replaced.

```html
<!-- templates/page/another_index.html.eex -->
<p>Students from UCLL are so great!
    They can make a website with Phoenix in English and Japanese!</p>
```
There was no 'another_index.html.eex'-file yet. so create one.



When you fire up your web app, you'll see a simple website with two links. That is what we're going to internationalize.
```bash
$ iex -S mix phx.server
```
